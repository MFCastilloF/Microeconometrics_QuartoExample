## How to download the required data

In order to download the required data for the excersices in this virtual resource you will find the datasets for free acces in (I guess this will not be the definitive repository, but for the moment I will write mine) [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/NLeivaD/Microeconometrics_QuartoExample/Datasets).
