## How to download the required data

All data required for code call outs and exercises can be found at the following link:
[damianclarke.net/books/microeconometrics/data](damianclarke.net/books/microeconometrics/data)

All data is available as csv format which can be easily read into R and Python, as well as Stata's native dta format.  Data can be downloaded and accessed locally, or read into programs directly from the link above.  Below we provide a brief illustration of how data can be read directly into R, Python and Stata from this site.  Here we simply install one of the datasets used in Chapter 2 code call outs, and print the first line in the file:

## R
```{R}
df <- read.csv('http://www.damianclarke.net/books/microeconometrics/data/Banerjee_et_al_2021.csv')
df[1,]
```

## Stata
```{stata}
webuse set www.damianclarke.net/books/microeconometrics/data
webuse Banerjee_et_al_2021
list in 1
```

## Python
```{python}
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('http://www.damianclarke.net/books/microeconometrics/data/Banerjee_et_al_2021.csv')
df[0:1]
```
