### Block 2.1

To understand the equivalence between regression analysis and the comparison of means in a binary regression set-up, we refer to Section 2.1 of the online coding resource. In this section, we work with data from a randomized control trial that examines asset transfers to poor households in India, as discussed in the paper by Banerjee et al. (2021).

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Statamarkdown)
```

```{stata}

* Load the household data
use "Datasets/Banerjee_et_al_2021.dta", clear

/* Simple Regression for ind_fin_el1: We run a simple regression of the variable ind_fin_el1 on the treatment variable, filtering the data to only include observations where el1 == 1.This is done to isolate the effect of the treatment on a particular group or under certain conditions, where in this case el1 corresponds to the first wave of responses.
*/
  
reg ind_fin_el1 treatment if el1==1
scalar coef_treatment = _b[treatment]


* Calculate mean for the treatment group
summarize ind_fin_el1 if treatment==1 & el1==1
scalar mean_treatment = r(mean)


* Calculate mean for the control group
summarize ind_fin_el1 if treatment==0 & el1==1
scalar mean_control = r(mean)


* Calculate and display the difference in means
scalar diff_means = mean_treatment - mean_control
display "Coefficient for treatment in regression: " coef_treatment
display "Difference in means (Treatment - Control): " diff_means

* Display the comparison
di "The coefficient from the regression should be equal to the difference in means to demonstrate equivalence."
```

By following these steps, we can empirically verify that in a binary regression set-up, the coefficient for the treatment variable in a simple OLS regression is equivalent to the difference in means between the treatment and control groups. This serves as a useful check for the validity of our regression model and strengthens the causal interpretation of the treatment effect.
