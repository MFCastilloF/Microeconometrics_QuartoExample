## Synthetic Control Exercise

The synthetic control method seeks to construct a "synthetic control" for a treated unit (in this case, California) using a weighted combination of control units (other states). The aim is for this synthetic control to closely resemble the treated unit in the pre-treatment period based on predictor variables.

-   Use the 'synth' command to construct the synthetic control for California
-   Predictor variables: cigsale from specific years, beer, lnincome, retprice, age15to24
-   Treated unit: California (state==3)
-   Treatment period: 1989
-   Periods used to construct the synthetic control: 1980-1988

Once the synthetic control is constructed, we can compare the trends of the treated unit and the synthetic control in the post-treatment period. Any divergence in trends is interpreted as the treatment effect. In this case, we are assessing the impact of a hypothetical policy implemented in California in 1989 on cigarette sales.

```{python}

import pandas as pd
from SyntheticControlMethods import Synth

# Load the Dataset
df = pd.read_csv("Datasets/Abadie_data.csv")

# Prepare the Data
df = df.sort_values(by=['state', 'year'])

# Define the treatment period and the unit receiving the treatment
treatment_period = 1989
treated_unit = 'California'

# Predictor variables - Ensure these are present in your dataset
predictors = ['cigsale', 'beer', 'lnincome', 'retprice', 'age15to24']

# Fit the Synthetic Control Model
sc = Synth(df, "cigsale", "state", "year", treatment_period, treated_unit, pen=0)

# Visualize the Synthetic Control
sc.plot(["original", "pointwise", "cumulative"], treated_label="California", 
        synth_label="Synthetic California", treatment_label="Tobacco Policy Change")

```

**Results:**

-   The synthetic control for California is constructed using a combination of other states. Specifically, weights are assigned to states like Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.
-   The RMSPE (Root Mean Squared Prediction Error) is a measure of how well the synthetic control approximates California in the pre-treatment period. A lower RMSPE indicates a better fit. In this case, the RMSPE is 1.756235, suggesting a reasonably good fit.
-   The "Predictor Balance" table shows how California and the synthetic control compare in terms of the predictor variables. The figures show that there is a good balance between the treated unit and the synthetic control on these variables.
-   The graph displays per capita cigarette sales in California and the synthetic control over time. The divergence between the two lines post-1989 represents the estimated effect of the policy
