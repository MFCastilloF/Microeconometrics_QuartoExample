    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe study of economics is the study of human behaviour, and in practice, many of the questions we wish to answer are related to causal effects. How do people or organisations respond if they are exposed to one set of incentives instead of another? How has the implementation of a public policy affected some individual or aggregate measure of well-being? How does exposure to some unexpected shock shape the outcomes of an individual over their life-course? How do countries develop if some particular institution is in place rather than another? All of these questions are inherently causal in nature, and central to discourse in economic research.\nThe importance of questions of causality has been reflected in at least two recent Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economics. In 2019, Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer were awarded this Prize for applying experimental methods to questions related to global poverty, and in 2021 the work of Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens, who were awarded the Prize alongside David Card, was explicitly highlighted for its “methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships”. These are unlikely to be the last Nobel Prizes in this vein. %https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA21204\nHowever, beyond these specific themes elevated by the Nobel committee, work on causality is seen in fundamental questions in all fields of economic endeavour where microeconometric methods are used. To consider a number of emblematic examples, (Miguel and Kremer 2004; Baird et al. 2016) consider the causal effect of deworming treatments on child well-being in the short and long-term. XXXXX Indeed, if you open up a recent issue of one of your favourite economics journals, it is exceedingly likely that empirical findings purporting to isolate causal effects of some variable on some other variable will be reported.\nNOTE PAPER FROM AEA:P & P noting causality revolution.\nWhat’s more, these questions are not only of importance for the way which we understand human behaviour, but also for the way which policies are designed and the way which the world is run. JPAL, PROGRESA as an example… A/B testing as another.\nOne thing which distinguishes economics from other fields interested in causal methods such as physics or medicine is that a considerable proportion of the phenomena whose causal effect we wish to isolate may not be easily manipulable by researchers. For example, consider variables such as exposure to changing climates or extreme weather events, whether a country adopts a democratic regime, or the total amount of schooling which an individual accrues during their life. These variables are of major relevance to economic policy, but there is no way for these to be precisely manipulated by researchers in a laboratory. At the same time, there are many creative studies which have experimentally manipulated variables which are of first order importance for policies, see for example XXXXX. The breadth of phenomena under study, and the need to interact with both observational and experimental settings, points to the importance of having a clearly defined framework of causal analysis. In this chapter, we will lay out the foundation of causal analysis in micro-econometric analysis.\n%Causal Effects as an Object of Interest"

    "section": "1.2 A Framework for Causal Analysis",
    "text": "1.2 A Framework for Causal Analysis\nThe workhorse framework for causal analysis in microeconometrics is the so called Rubin Causal Model. At its heart, this model is relatively simple, but as we will see throughout this book, it provides a powerful way to help us think about causality across a very broad range of observational and experimental settings. The Rubin Causal Model (RCM) is generally ascribed to (Rubin 1974), and this naming was first used in (Holland 1986, 946).^[In naming this as Rubin’s Model for Causal Inference in the title of his Section 3 (Holland 1986) states: > ’**I refer to this as “Rubin’s model” even though Rubin would argue that the ideas behind the model have been around since Fisher. I think that Rubin (1974) was the place where these ideas were first applied to the study of causation.’\n]\nHowever, the genesis of this model is considerably longer, dating back to ideas introduced by (Splawa-Neyman 1923,1990) in his Masters thesis and (Fisher 1925), both applied to randomised trials. A very nice discussion of the history of the RCM is available in (Imbens and Rubin 2015, chap. 2).\nThe RCM breaks down our undertsanding of causality into two separate parts. A first part of the model is the potential outcome framework, which provides us with a way to think about causal effects. And a second part is an assignment mechanism which describes how treatments are assigned to units, and the nature of the `experiment’ or event which generated the observational data with which we work. We will examine these two parts in turn.\n\n\n\n\nBaird, Sarah, Joan Hamory Hicks, Edward Miguel, and Michael Kremer. 2016. “Worms at Work: Long-run Impacts of a Child Health Investment.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 131 (4): 1637–80.\n\n\nFisher, R.
